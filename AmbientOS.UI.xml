      Actually, let's refine that:
      A shell is just an environment for the action, that can be used by the action
      to interact with the platform. If, e.g. an action is executed in a console, that doesn't
      mean that the console is used for all user interaction. The job of figuring out the right mode of
      interaction is the job of the user experience service.

        If the shell makes the decision, it shall do so according to the following rules:
        If the user has answered the same question previously in the same or similar context, the last selection shall be returned.
