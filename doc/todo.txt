- reduce warnings in NTFS code
- create ObjectProvider interface (vs ObjectTransformer)
- provide LocalObject constraint (or semi local?), or create windows specific interfaces
- review DynamicSet (what about read-only?)
- create tests for everything
- implement remote connections
- update the overview and thoughts documents

furthermore:
- new areas: GUI, Bluetooth (demo app), (updates)
- remoting (authentication, encryption, privileges)
- attempt to remove the need of local references that wrap the implementation
- rebase webserver
- think about multipeer systems (as opposed to simple client-server)
- rebase S1 simulator
- rebase S1 remote control
- port to C++x
- rebase kernel
- rebase S1 firmware

build system:
- make interface parser show errors with accurate line numbers
- read up on best reference counting practices (and implement code analyzer)
- implement code analyzer to forbid context usage in early init code
- code analyzer to forbid invalid usage of ObjectProvider attribute
- code analyzer to check validity of all classes used in ByteConverter
