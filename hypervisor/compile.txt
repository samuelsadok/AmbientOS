
1. INSTALL MINGW




2. COMPILE BOOTSECTOR

yasm -a x86 -f bin -g null -m x86 -o bootsect.bin bootsect.asm

-p gas/gnu/nasm/tasm to change parser
-r nasm/tasm/raw/cpp/gas to change preprocessor
-m x86/amd64 to change machine




3. COMPILE BOOTLOADER

gcc blabla




4. INSTALL OS

overwrite 1st sector of partition with bootsect.bin

overwrite some random sectors with bootloader.bin

mark the used partition as active in MBR (change attribte to 0x80)
the last 4*16 Bytes before the 0x55AA are 4 partition descriptors

point bootsector to the bootloader
the last 8 bytes on the second last line (0x1E8) point to the bootloader sector
