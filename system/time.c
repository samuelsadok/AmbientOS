/*
*
* Provides platform-independent functions related to timers and clock.
*
*	- Timers
*		slightly inaccurate (±3%)
*		resolution: 1 millisecond
*		maximum interval of ~50 days
*		meant for timing real-time events
*
*	- Real Time Clock
*		accurate measure of the current time and date
*		resolution: 1 second
*		may change unpredictably at any time
*
* Timers are currently not thread safe (the only guaranteed safety is that the timer_update does not interfere with timer_start and timer_stop).
*
* Architecture-specific support required:
*	timer_register_callback:
*		shall register a callback to be called exactly once after the specified interval (multiple calls override previous callbacks)
*	system_ticks:
*		shall return a 16-bit number that increments by 1 every ~1ms
*
* created: 09.03.15
